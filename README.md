First Module of a initial project (on web platform) in which it's possible to load XBRL instances (native XML file, without relational database) through the use of XML DOM (Document Object Model) and JavaScript technologies.
Main ideia of this project is to focus in web usability, through javascript solutions, becoming a very rich web XBRL editor.
